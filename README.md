CMAPSS Jet Engine Predictive Maintenance

This project utilizes the CMAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset to develop predictive models for estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines. The CMAPSS dataset, provided by NASA, contains simulated sensor data for various engine operating conditions and fault modes.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be accessed from NASA's official repository: CMAPSS Dataset Download
Dataset Description

The CMAPSS dataset includes:

    Multivariate time-series sensor data.
    Four sub-datasets, each representing different operating conditions and fault modes.
    Features such as engine unit number, time in cycles, operational settings, and sensor measurements.
    Labels indicating the RUL for engines in their respective datasets.

Project Objectives

    Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
    Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from sensor data to improve model performance.
    Model Development: Build and train machine learning models to predict the RUL of engines.
    Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics like RMSE and MAE.

Setup Instructions

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cmapss-rul-prediction.git
    cd cmapss-rul-prediction

    Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Download the CMAPSS dataset from the official link and place the files in the data/ directory.

    Run the notebook or scripts to train and evaluate the model.

Key Features

    Data visualization to explore sensor data and trends.
    Flexible model configurations supporting multiple algorithms like Random Forest, LSTM, and GRU.
    Robust preprocessing pipeline to handle noisy and high-dimensional data.

Future Improvements

    Memory-Augmented Models: Integrate memory mechanisms (e.g., attention layers, external memory units) into the model architecture to incorporate past sensor data with the current data for better RUL predictions.
    Explainability: Implement techniques like SHAP or LIME to interpret model predictions and improve trustworthiness.
    Transfer Learning: Explore the use of pre-trained models or domain adaptation to generalize predictions across similar datasets.
    Real-Time Monitoring: Develop a pipeline for real-time sensor data streaming and RUL prediction.
